        ‚ÄúThere is a very fertile ground in New York based on a very populist agenda: crime is up, the economy is a mess, people are fleeing the state in droves, taxes are too high, the services are too bad. The situation is abysmal and I think it‚Äôs shifting the political dynamics in favor of the Republicans. That doesn‚Äôt have to do with the brilliance of the party. That just has to do with the fact that the average Joe-Schmo, the average Sally-Jane, realizes they‚Äôre spending more money and they‚Äôre getting less in return,‚Äù he said. Wax argues enthusiastically that the key to flipping the state red is getting a third of New York City to vote for a Republican.
