### Serving up Websites!

GitHub is also great for serving up static websites. Right now, you have the code for your website on GitHub, but its not being served up anywhere. GitHub is only storing the code. Luckily, if your code happens to be a website, GitHub can also host it for you through a feature called "GitHub Pages". 

Simply go to the "settings" menu, scroll down to "GitHub Pages", and select "master branch"

Whatever is in your master branch on GitHub should now appear at 

```
http://your-username.github.io/repository-name
```

in my case it is [**http://dmil.github.io/my-simple-website**](http://dmil.github.io/my-simple-website)
