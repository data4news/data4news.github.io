    - Move the issue to "in progress" on the [project board](https://github.com/data4news/my-simple-website/projects/2).

2. Now let's all take a second to comment on someone else's issue

3. Implement the change on your issue by editing [one of the files here](https://github.com/data4news/my-simple-website). You can do that by first clicking on the name of the file, then hitting the edit button on that file.
