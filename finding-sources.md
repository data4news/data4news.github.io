# Finding Sources on GitHub

### Part 1: Source Finding Challenge (FEC data)

Suppose we're working on a story about donations to political campaigns in an upcoming election. The [Federal Election Comission](https://www.fec.gov/data/) has data on donations, but you're finding some oddities. Negative numbers in donation amounts, large amounts of money being transferred from one committee to the next that you're not sure how to trace back to the donor, etc. You think these are not issues with the data, but with your own understanding of the data. You need help! 

Let's use GitHub to generate a list of sources who might help you. Don't enter any source twice. If someone beats you to entering the name of a source, try to find someone else!

_Hints: You may want to try_
- entering search terms related to campaign finance or "Federal Election Comission" to find some relevant repositories (some may be owned by the FEC, others by new organizations/hobbyists/etc... people who use the data)
- the GitHub user who created a related repository or seems to be contributing a lot to it
- people who seem to be making issues or commenting on them
- people who are creating pull requests on relevant repositories


### Part 2: Source finding Challenge (Your own project)

Make a copy of this worksheet:
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jPqkGQ4cfh-tKW-1-4_lZdRcxx80Y1P2OzlAtuAGKhU/edit#gid=0

Use it to find sources and repositories that might be relevant to a story you're working on.
